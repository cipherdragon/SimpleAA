# Authorship Attribution Through Machine Learning and Stylometry

## Overview
This project implements advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect similarity between English and Singlish texts, a hybrid language blend of English and Sinhala commonly used in Sri Lanka. The system includes features such as dataset creation, feature engineering, model building, and frontend/backend implementation.

## Key Features
- Random Forest Classifier for similarity detection
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for English variant detection
- Feature extraction scripts for Sinhala to English ratio and edit distance calculations
- LSTM models for gender prediction
- Global alignment algorithms for handling variations and misspellings
